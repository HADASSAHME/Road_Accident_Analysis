# ROAD_ACCIDENT_ANALYISIS(Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)


### PROJECT OVERVEIW

 This project dataset was used to show the trend line of road accident in the current and prevdious year,
 and how various influencces such as; Vehicle types, road surfaces, light conditions, can affect the rate of accident occurance.
 
 ### DATA SOURCES
 
 The demo dataset for this project was gotten from kagdgle.com containing detailed information about the data set [download here]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/...)

 ### TOOLS

 - MS Excel (Data Cleaning,Data Analysis and Data Visualization)

 ### DATA CLEANING/PREPARATION.

 In the intital data preparation phase, i performed the following task:
 1. Data loading and inspection.
 2. Handling missing and null values.
  3. Data cleaning by checking for spelling erors.
 4. Data formatting.

###  EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS(EDA)

EDA involed exploring the data and asking questions such as;
1. For Primary KPIs
   - The Total casualties taken place after the accident.
   - Total casualties of Total with respect to Accident_Severity and maximum Casualties by type of vehicle.
 2. For Secondary KPIs
    - Total casualties with respect to Vehicle_Type,showing the Monthly trend comparison of the current and previous year.
    - Maximum casualties by Road_Type.
    - Relationship between casualties by Area/Location and byDay/Night.

### DATA ANALYSIS

I used Pivot tables to calculate aggregate data and also build charts.

### RESULTS

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1.From the Primary KPI 
- It was realized that there are more occurances of casualties in accident with Slight_Severity.
2. From the Secondary KPI;
 - The monthly trend of casulties showed that the previous year(2021) had more casualties recorded than the current year (2022)
 - Distribution of casualties by road_Surface showed that more casualties are  likely to be recorded on Dry Road_Surface with (98,182) casualties
   as compared to other Road_Surface accidents.

  - The relationship between casualties caused by Location and by either Day or N ight is that the both have the same Total number of casulties.so it doesnt
    matter if the accident happpens in the Rural area at Night or the Urban area during the Daytime.
